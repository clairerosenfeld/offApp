# offApp
2019 CS 147/CS 47 react native app 

Tools Used: 
We built our high-fidelity prototype with React Native and Expo. We used Apple’s Xcode Simulator to test the app as we developed it. 

Operating Instructions: 
You can access our prototype on an iOS device, on an android device, or online. We recommend accessing it on an iOS device. (Note: the app is optimized for the iPhone X.) To access the app on an iOS device:
1. Download “Expo Client” from the App Store
2. Login to Expo with username: offapp@gmail.com / password: 123off
3. Open your phone browser and visit https://expo.io/@clairero/offApp
4. Click the rectangular purple button labelled “Open project using Expo”

Hard Coded Elements:
To create the experience of a fully functioning app, we hardcoded various information into our prototype. 
1. The activities are brainstormed and entered by us. 
2. The content of the digest is hardcoded. The digest notifications are merely pictures of iOS notifications. 
3. The contact information (phone numbers & email addresses) used for responding to notifications on the digest is entered by us. 

Future Ideas:
Our app isn’t perfect! There are still many features yet to be implemented. 
1. The notifications in digest page are all hard-coded. I'd like to eliminate the hard-coding of the digest page and implement real notifications for users.
2. The auto-reply functionality does not work. I'd like to figure out how to make it work. I image this would require a complex workaround with iOS restrictions.
1. Scrolling within the pull-up bottom sheet that contains the auto-response options can be glitchy. I'd like to improve this. 
2. There is no way to add your own activities. I'd like to make it so users can enter in their own activities, if they'd like. 
3. After a user quits their digest, it's gone for good. I'd like to implement a "history" feature where users can view their past digests. 
4. Aside from scrolling and clicking on notifications, the digest lacks interactability (if that's a word). I'd like to add the ability to swipe left on a notification to dismiss it and swipe right to bookmark/flag/star it.
